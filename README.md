# Simulation-of-the-Universe
Simulation of our world in 3d
The idea of the project is to simulate our Universe.
In the project you get a 3d solar system simulation with the Earth and digital people on it.

You can move an Actor and interact with different objects like bed, fridge and tv.
There is also an Actress roaming in an apartment and doing different things (sleeping, taking shower, watching tv, etc.)

Ideally, there should work all the laws of physics, biology and chemics, human beings should behave as in real life.
This is implemented in a VERY simplified way.

For this project I used 3d models downloaded for free (from resources like sweethouse).
If you want to use any part of my code for any purposes, feel free to do so, but let me know, please.
